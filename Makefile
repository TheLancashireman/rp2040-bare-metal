# Description of targets:
#	test:			runs header-test and compile-test
#	header-test:	builds and runs a host-based program to check the structure offsets in the header files
#	compile-test:	compiles source files from the c and s directories and creates a library
# Note: none of the above builds anything that runs on an RP2040 target board.
